  <p> Jonathan and Nancy purchase weapons for monster hunting before they can go back into the woods. Nancy sees a defaced movie marquee with derogatory messages about her spray-painted on top of it. </p>
  <hr>
  <p> While trying to find the gate to the Upside Down, Lucas rides his bike and finds that the compass is pointing towards Hawkins Laboratory. Meanwhile, Mike and Dustin are cornered on a cliff by Troy and James. </p>
  <hr>
  <p> Troy threatens Dustin with a switchblade, saying he will cut out his teeth if Mike doesn't jump. Mike jumps, but before he hits the water he freezes in mid-air and levitates back to safety. El appears on the road and uses her powers to break Troy's arm.  </p>
  <hr>
  <p> As El falls to the ground, a flashback shows her succeeding in making contact with the Monster. El apologizes, claiming she is the monster for having opened the gate. </p>
  <hr>
  <p> Mike comforts her, saying she isn't the monster because she saved him. Mike and El hug each other, and Dustin joins in. </p>
